To run the application, unzip the file into a location that can be reached by a text editor. For this, I used Atom text editor.
Most browsing applications block any local files being processed through an input file onto an html page due to security reasons.




1) Open the project in atom or another text editor and open an html preview (in Atom, it is ctrl + shift+ h).

2) When the preview comes up, choose the text file that you would like to test the algorithms with, then click the button of the corresponding algorithm. This will run the algorithm
and the necessary components including execution time, hull points, graphics etc.

3) To run another algorithm or txt file, you must hit clear. After clearing, you may choose a new file. If you are simply running the same txt file but the other algorithm, you may go right ahead to display side by side
execution times.
